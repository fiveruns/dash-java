<h2>FiveRuns Dash Java API</h2>
<p>
  The Dash Java API provides basic metric support for Java applications.  It does not support traces
  or exceptions as of this release.
</p>
<h3>Application Integration</h3>
<p>
  To use Dash in your application, you need to:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Add Java code to your application which configures and starts Dash.</li>
    <li>Add Dash and its dependencies to your application's classpath.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Configuring Dash</h3>
<p>
  Dash is configured via a simple Java API.  Import the core Dash classes:
  
  <pre>
  import com.fiveruns.dash.*;
  </pre>
  
  Create a list of metric recipes that you wish to monitor:
  
  <pre>
  Recipe[] recipes = {
      Recipe.getJvmRecipe(),
  };
  </pre>
  
  Pass in your application token and recipe listing to the <code>Plugin.start</code> method.

  <pre>
    Plugin.start("change-me-to-your-app-token", recipes);
  </pre>
  
  This will spin off a thread which will regularly collect and send metrics to Dash.
</p>
<h3>Running Dash</h3>
<p>
  Dash has three runtime dependencies.  You will need to add the Dash jar along with Apache's commons-httpclient 3.1, commons-logging 1.0.4 and commons-codec 1.2 to your classpath.
